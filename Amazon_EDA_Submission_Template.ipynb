Visualizations and data summaries help identify which genres are most common, how content ratings are distributed, how Prime’s content library has evolved over time, and which regions contribute the most content. The findings provide a deeper understanding of Amazon Prime's content strategy and offer data-driven recommendations to enhance viewer engagement and platform performance.\n",

        "4.  **Missing Value Handling:** Addressed missing values in several columns:\n",
        "    *   `description`: Filled missing values with the string 'No description available'.\n",
        "    *   `age_certification`: Filled missing values with the string 'Not Rated'.\n",

        "    *   `imdb_id`: Filled missing values with the string 'Unknown'.\n",
        "    *   `character`: Filled missing values with the string 'N/A'.\n",
        "5.  **Data Type Conversion:**\n",
        "    *   Converted the `seasons` column from float64 to integer using `pd.to_numeric` and `astype(int)`.\n",
        "    *   Converted the `imdb_votes` column from float64 to integer using `pd.to_numeric` and `astype(int)`.\n",

        "2.  **Duplicate Data:** The presence of 168 duplicate rows highlighted the need for cleaning before analysis to ensure accurate counts and statistics.\n",
        "3.  **Missing Data Significance:** Several columns had a significant number of missing values, particularly `seasons`, `age_certification`, and rating/popularity scores. This indicated that not all titles had complete metadata, and appropriate handling (like filling with 0, mean, or 'Unknown') was necessary to proceed with analysis without losing too much data. The high number of missing values in `seasons` was expected for movies.\n",
        "4.  **Variable Types:** The variables included a mix of object (string), integer, and float types. The need for data type conversion for columns like `seasons` and `imdb_votes` was identified to ensure they were in appropriate numeric formats for analysis. Converting categorical columns to the 'category' dtype was a good step for memory efficiency.\n",
        "5.  **List Representation:** The `genres` and `production_countries` columns were stored as string representations of lists, requiring conversion to actual lists for easier processing and extraction of individual genres or countries.\n",
        "6.  **Data Ready for Analysis:** After handling duplicates, missing values, and converting data types, the `merged_df` is now in a more suitable format for exploratory data analysis, including the newly engineered `primary_genre` and `primary_country` features which will be useful for high-level categorical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "These initial manipulations and insights form the foundation for the subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps outlined in the project structure. The next phases will likely involve analyzing the distributions of these variables, looking for relationships between them, and creating visualizations to uncover deeper patterns in the Amazon Prime catalog."
